## History
Originally born from a simple console app, DailyAww was first called MiAww, named for the Mid-South Immigration Advocates that it serviced. The fine people at MIA deal with some emotionally heavy things all day long (mostly terrible things happening to children), and as their volunteer tech guy, I was asked to provide some cute kittens and puppies in their inbox everyday. MiAww was the result of that request. For Hacktoberfest, I elected to expand and feature-up it into a more fully featured app to make use of my azure credits.
